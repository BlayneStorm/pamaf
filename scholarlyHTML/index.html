                Pamaf is a student project in which the player fights the other teachers in a Pac-man style. This document
                describes the main ideas/concepts, as well as the User Experience and the way in which the authors
                collaborated.

            <p>
                Games have always been a way in which people had fun. Originating with Pac-man, Pamaf wants to achieve the
                same greatness by adding a twist to the game: phantoms become teachers and our yellow little friend is
                represented by our profile picture. This way, students are able to face one of their biggest nightmares in
                a fun and addicting way.

            <p>
                We have started from the idea that we would like a simple interface in which the main point is for the
                players to get to the game as fast as possible. We did respect that, but we have also added a few other
                pages, like the History, Rules or Scoreboard. There is also a Contact page if you ever feel the need to
                reach us.
                There have been ups and downs and a lot of changes during the first phases of development, but overall we
                think that we've done a good job on having a layout that is fast, good on the eye and also easy to
                understand and easy to navigate.<br>

                    by the player himself. Game style is each player plays a match separately whenever he wants. 
                    This was inspired by other apps such as DrawMyThing where a game is represented by a cycle of draw-and-guess 
                    between players that have chosen to play together (they can hold many games  “open” at the same time)

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The concept of client-side storage has been around for a long time. Since the early days of the web, sites have used cookies to store information to personalize user experience on websites. They're the earliest form of client-side storage commonly used on the web.
                Because of that age, there are a number of problems — both technical and user experience-wise — afflicting cookies. These problems are significant enough that upon visiting a site for the first time, people living in Europe are shown messages informing them if they will use cookies to store data about them. This is due to a piece of European Union legislation known as the EU Cookie directive. Nowadays, WebStorage and IndexedDB is the way to go. The Web Storage API provides a very simple syntax for storing and retrieving smaller, data items consisting of a name and a corresponding value. This is useful when you just need to store some simple data, like the user's name, whether they are logged in, what color to use for the background of the screen, etc. The IndexedDB API provides the browser with a complete database system for storing complex data. This can be used for things from complete sets of customer records to even complex data types like audio or video files. While there is the Cache API that promises way better techniques of storing information on the client-side, it is not yet supported by many browsers and such, we will be using WebStorage and IndexedDB.
